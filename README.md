# Sokoban

> **Note:** This project was my submission for a computer science assignment in sixth form.

An implementation of the puzzle game [Sokoban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sokoban) written in Python and Pygame. It supports the loading of custom campaigns in the [Sokoban level format](http://www.sokobano.de/wiki/index.php?title=Level_format).
